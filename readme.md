# Writing digits with a GAN

This is merely a jupyter notebook transcription of [O'Reilly's course on the subject](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/generative-adversarial-networks-for-beginners).

Working with TensorFlow 1.4, I've added some lines to prevent TF from crashing (because of the `renew argument).

The idea is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to write convincing digits.
